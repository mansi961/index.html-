  <p>
    I am a final-year Information Technology student at New Jersey Institute of Technology with
    hands-on experience in IT support, technical troubleshooting, and user-focused problem solving.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I work as an IT Support / Help Desk Technician at Hudson County Community College,
    where I assist students and faculty with hardware, software, and classroom technology across
    Windows and macOS environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside IT support, I have experience with programming and academic projects using Python,
    Java, C++, C, HTML, CSS, and Unity. I am eager to grow professionally and contribute to reliable,
    efficient, and secure IT systems.
