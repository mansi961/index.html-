  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p><em>
    "Consistency, curiosity, and continuous learning define my approach to technology."
  </em></p>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Mansi Sangani</strong>, and I am a final-year Information Technology student
    at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, specializing in Web Applications.
    I am passionate about technology, problem-solving, and helping users through reliable
    and efficient IT support.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work as an <strong>IT Support / Help Desk Technician</strong> at
    Hudson County Community College, where I support students, faculty, and staff with
    day-to-day technical issues. My responsibilities include troubleshooting
    Windows and macOS systems, maintaining classroom technology, assisting with login
    and account issues, and ensuring smooth operation of campus IT services.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to IT support, I have a strong interest in programming and development.
    I have hands-on experience with <strong>Python, Java, C++, C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>,
    and I have worked on academic and team-based projects focused on automation,
    system efficiency, and software development.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my technical skills, and collaborating
    with others to solve real-world problems. My goal is to grow professionally in the IT field,
    contribute to user-focused solutions, and continue expanding my knowledge in networking,
    system support, and web technologies.
