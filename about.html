  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p class="quote">
    "Consistency, curiosity, and continuous learning define my approach to technology."
  </p>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Mansi Sangani</strong>, and I am a final-year Information Technology student
    at New Jersey Institute of Technology. I have a strong interest in IT support, system
    troubleshooting, and user-focused technical solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently work as an <strong>IT Support / Help Desk Technician</strong> at Hudson County
    Community College, where I assist students and faculty with hardware, software,
    and classroom technology issues across Windows and macOS environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my IT support experience, I have hands-on knowledge of programming languages
    including Python, Java, C++, and web technologies. I enjoy solving problems,
    improving system efficiency, and continuously expanding my technical skill set.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am actively seeking opportunities where I can grow professionally,
    contribute to reliable IT operations, and support users through effective
    technology solutions.
